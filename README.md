# Toonku

**Toonku** is my personal shader for my VRChat avatars. If you've seen me in one of my avatars in VR, you've seen it. Uses [**atat**](https://github.com/Lakuwu/atat).

I started working on **Toonku** in April 2020, around the time I began learning shader programming with Unity. A lot of work has gone into it since then; its core, the toon shading algorithm or whatever you wish to call it, has remained much the same.
